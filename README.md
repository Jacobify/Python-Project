# Python-Project

Hi , welcome to my python project repository.

![342cb5667d5d21f6770d0f02281fbf58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39615077/194693556-d97bfdfd-fd65-4d33-bb41-d4eda9f38b8a.gif)

For now this repo is going to contain all the files regarding my exercises until i define the project and add the new codes.

Hopefully it may end up helping you in your codes.

I have not decided which Python library i am going to use ,However, this project's main point will be mainly about image processing and little about deep learning concepts.

-- this file will change as i go through with it.

Thank you for your time
